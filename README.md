# Image-Classification


Description:
Your task is to build a machine-learning model for image classification. The goal is to accurately classify
images into different categories based on their content. You will work with a provided dataset containing
around 25,000 images of size 150x150 pixels, distributed across six categories: buildings, forest, glacier,
mountain, sea, and street.


Dataset:
● The dataset is divided into three sets: train, validation, and test.
● Train set: Approximately 14,000 images.
● Validation set: Approximately 7,000 images.
● Test set: Approximately 3,000 images.
● Each image is labelled with the corresponding category (0 for buildings, 1 for forest, 2 for glacier, 3 for
mountain, 4 for sea, and 5 for street)
